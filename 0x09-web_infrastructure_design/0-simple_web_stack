Explanation of the Diagram:

    -The user's web browser initiates the process by typing www.foobar.com [invalid URL removed] in the address bar.
    -The browser sends a DNS lookup request to the DNS servers.
    -The DNS servers translate www.foobar.com [invalid URL removed] into the server's IP address (like 8.8.8.8 in this example).
    -The browser sends an HTTP request with the IP address and the specific webpage requested (e.g., homepage) to the foobar.com server.
    -Nginx, the web server on the foobar.com server, receives the request.
    -If the request is for static content (like images or HTML files), Nginx delivers it directly.
    -For dynamic content, Nginx forwards the request to the application server (e.g., Apache).
    -The application server processes the request and retrieves data from the database (MySQL) if needed.
    -The application server uses the code base (written in languages like PHP or Python) to generate the webpage content.
    -The application server sends the completed webpage back to Nginx.
    -Nginx sends an HTTP response containing the webpage content back to the user's browser.
    -The user's browser interprets the received data and displays the webpage (foobar.com) on the screen.
