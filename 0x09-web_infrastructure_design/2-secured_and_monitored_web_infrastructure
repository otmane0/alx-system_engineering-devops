Explanation of the Diagram:

    -The user's web browser initiates the process by typing www.foobar.com [invalid URL removed] [invalid URL removed] [invalid URL removed] in the address bar and establishes a secure connection using HTTPS.
    -The user's request first passes through the firewall on the load balancer (Server 3) for basic security checks.
    -The load balancer uses a distribution algorithm (e.g., Round Robin) to select one of the available web servers (Nginx on Server 1 or Server 2).
    -The request reaches the chosen web server (Nginx) and is filtered by its firewall for additional security.
    -Nginx might serve static content directly or forward the request to the application server (Apache on Server 2) for dynamic content.
    -The application server interacts with the database (potentially on a separate machine) to retrieve or update data.
    -The specific database configuration depends on the chosen approach (Master-Slave or Multi-master replication).
    -The application server uses the codebase to generate the requested webpage content.
    -The response is sent back to Nginx.
    -The response passes through the firewall on the web server for security checks.
    -Nginx sends the response to the load balancer.
    -The load balancer decrypts the response using its SSL certificate (potential performance bottleneck).
    -The response is filtered by the firewall on the load balancer for final security checks.
    -The load balancer encrypts the response again and sends it back to the user's browser over HTTPS.
    -The user's browser decrypts the data and displays the webpage (foobar.com).
    -Monitoring clients on each server collect data on performance, resource usage, and potential errors, sending it to a central monitoring service for analysis and alerting.
